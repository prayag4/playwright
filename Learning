What is Page Object Model (POM)?
Page Object Model is a design pattern used in test automation where you:
Represent each page (or section of a page) in your app as a class.
Put all the locators and page actions in that class.
Keep the test scripts separate, using those classes.

POM Benefits:
Locators live in one place.
Tests are more readable.
Easy to reuse page actions.
If UI changes, update only the page file, not every test.

Playwright script will have :
add,edit and delete operations


NOTE : PRACTICE PAJE OBJECT MODEL AND ALSO SIMPLE WITH PLAYWRIGHT FUNCTION TO RECALL THEM AS WELL
